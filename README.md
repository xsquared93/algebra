# A little computer algebra system

## Overview
Here, the computational object is a rational function; this program manipulates rational functions, fractions whose denominator,
and numerator are univariable polynomials, as conceptual units.

## Why this program exists
I wrote this program because I wanted to apply the idea in
           [How To Learn Hacking](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacking-howto.html) by Eric Raymond; moreover, I wrote it to
apply one of the ideas in `SICP`, a classic computer science textbook; namely, I applied the idea of data abstraction. Finally,
I also applied, or at least tried to apply, the design recipe from the book `HtDP` by Felleisen and colleagues.

# Things left to do
- [ ] provide function level documentation;
- [ ] rewrite how data is represented - get rid of the `print` procedures;
- [ ] provide unit tests.

## Developed with
- Emacs; and 
- MIT-Scheme.
